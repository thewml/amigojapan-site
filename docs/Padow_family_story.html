We escaped from the tzar who was oppressing the Jews.		Back in Lithuania the Padow family name used to be called Ezra. Which became Ezrahovich which apparently for some reason to do with Padua Italy the name was changed		to Padovich. When my great grandparents arrived at Elis island.  The authorities did not understand their last name and changed it to Padow.		My grand parents Alexander (born 1911 died at age 90) and Lilian (lived 97 years) where born in the United States in New York's lower east side and		eventually moved to Brooklyn where my father Robert Padow was born. They finally went to live in West Palm Beach FL. My grandfather was a chemist and my		grandmother an English teacher. My granparen’s hobby was playing bridge, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/01/nyregion/bridge-young-pair-draws-attention-at-an-event-in-white-plains.html">here is an article in the NY Times about them: </a>		<br/>		My father (Robert Frank, July 1940 - July 2013) was a piano tuner and aspiring movie writer.  He immigrated to Mexico where he met my		mom Gloria, aspiring writer (add links), in the state of Chiapas, my mother's home town is San Christobal de las Casas. My parents eventually settled in Mexico		City, where I was born the 8th of December, 1977. I lived in Mexico City until I was 19 years old, then I went to west palm beach to study at New England		Institute of Technology at Palm Beach where I earned an AS in computer programming technology and started working there after graduation. Meanwhile I studied		Japanese for 5 years. I arrived in Japan for a visit in 2001 and finally ended up living in Japan in 2002. I met my wife at a backpaker's hotel in Kyoto and we		soon got married. Our son was born in December 22, 2003. I have lived in Kawaguchi, Saitama prefecture, Japan for approximately 17 years (calculated relitavely from October 2002)		My wife does not like her name, so we call her "Lynn".  My son is called "Chihiro Alexander"		<br/><br/>Please take the time to read my father's works which were very valuable to him:		<br/>(English) <a href="/dad/Goldmine.pdf">Goldmine in the sky</a>, the tragic story about one of my father's friends		<br/>(English) <a href="/dad/Guys.pdf">Guys from the avenew</a>, a story about Flatbush Brooklyn NY in the 1950s		<br/>(English) <a href="/dad/World.pdf">World corners</a>, an article written by my dad		<br/>(Spanish) <a href="/dad/El_Casamiento.pdf">El casamiento de Jovita</a>, play that takes place in Mexico		<br/>(SPanish) <a href="/dad/EL_Capitan.pdf">El capitán tiene malos sueños</a>, Spanish adaptation of Nelson Algren's "The captain has bad dreams"		<br/><br/>Usmar A Padow (amigojapan) usmpadow@gmail.com - 2015
