       		<div class="maincol">        	<h2>Two kinds of programmers, the pros and cons of quick and dirty programming.</h2>        	<br/><br/>There are two kinds of intelligence, intuitiveness vs careful planning. in music some composers write down their music, and others just improvise on the spot. I think there are 2 kinds of programmers,  many , maybe most, are of the kind that when compared to a painter, like to sit down with a  ruler and a pencil and slowly draw a picture, making realistic pictures....  and then there are programmers like me,  that when compared with a painter worry more about the end product than how to do the thing... so they may get out a bucket of paint, and slap some on the walls, have dirty newspapers on the floor everywhere(and they end up with some kind of abstract Picasso like painting).. but I think this kind of programming is better for inventive people... probably not for like business or medical applications.....  <br/><br/>When you are working on something new, it is better not to worry about how to do it, and just do it <br/>I would argue the most optimal would be to apply the latter for prototypes and the former for the actual product <br/>I am better at prototypes. I am not really cut out for final products....    I don't think it is the same kind of people that do these things....    but often I run into people that say I should be like the painter with the ruler and paint a realistic painting, when I am really aiming for a piccaso like abstract painting<br/><br/>I also tend to want to work on new stuff , that hopefully has never been made before... I find boilerplate programming, like making web apps dreadfully boring<br/><br/>this:<br/> <img src="images/impossible_stairs.jpg" width=300 /> <br/>versus this: <br/><img src="images/picasso.jpg" width=300/><br/>Both kinds have their rightful place in art
