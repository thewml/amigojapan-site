       		<div class="maincol">		<h2>Classic funny moments in ##programming on freenode</h2>		<br/><h3>TempleOS</h3>		<br/>There is a guy that decided to make an OS from scratch. And not just any OS, but an OS that is a temple dedicated to God. He's obviously quite a religious extremist. this is quite an advanced OS, which includes many games and tools for example an IDE which instead of displaying just the filename of a 3d model in the editor, it actually displays the 3d model inside the editor with the code.		<br/>The most funny part is that one of the applications that runs inside his OS is a program called Talk to God, which uses an random number generator to get random words from the bible and put them together into sentences in some way,he really believes his application can talk directly to God, he thinks it is a derivative of “Talking in tongues”		<br/>this is the link to his OS webpage  <a href="http://www.templeos.org">http://www.templeos.org</a>		<br/>but I really recommend you watch <a href="http://www.templeos.org/Wb/Home/Wb2/Videos.html">his videos</a><br/><br/>BTW, we also have the developer of Satan Linux, so maybe they can duel it out some day :)		<br/><br/>		<br/><h3>Program to do everything</h3>		<br/>Some user had the idea that he could make a program that can replace all programs. He said for example a web site for ordering a taxi and a web site for ordering a pizza could all be simplified into a method for ordering anything and this could basically be made into a program that can do anything.		<br/>I mentioned to him that we seem to be going in the opposite direction. We have programs that do the same thing on different platforms, like Skype for iPhone and Skype for PC. Or apps to buy goods from Amazon on a smartphone. We will probably make more apps rather than scale down to a single app that does everything.		<br/><br/>		<br/><h3>Program to translate any programming language to any programming language</h3>		<br/>Someone told me that this was actually the same person that had the idea for the “Program to do everything” but I can’t remember their nicknames. this person insisted that he could make a translation program to convert a program written in any programming language to an equivalent program in any other programming language. his main idea was that every program is coupled into opcodes… and he thinks that all opcodes, being codes like that of an encryption algorithm, can be translated from one language to another. so his idea was basically that you wold compile say a C program, his program would read the binary opcodes, and confer that to an equivalent python program that does the same thing.		<br/>Needless to say that I mentioned that there are some things that can be done in one programming language and not in another, but it fell on deaf ears.		<br/><br/>		<br/><h3>The guy with the impossible request</h3>		<br/>recap: what engine (must be free and open source)  language must be Java, what IDE, must be easy to program in		<br/>as a game engine he refused unreal cause he wanted it to be totally free and open source, he does not want to pay 5% or royalties.		<br/>as a language he said it must be java cause "Minecraft in Java.		<br/>he even asked what IDE he should use, this is hte moment I thought, he is either too stupid to make a game or he is just trolling.		<br/>and he insisted it must be easy to program, finally saying he was going to use LibGDX which I told him was not as easy as unreal or Unity3d.		<br/>then he went on to tell me I am a &lt;40 IQ monkey.		<br/>also Anika is too strict with Unreal's 5% royalty fee,   but he is willing to pay 100 USD per year to the apple app store.		<br/>all of this took place in quite broken English.		<br/><br/>		<br/><h3>The complex image troll</h3>		<br/><b>pseudonym:</b>good morning, i have a programming issue today i can be quite elaborate upon, its about taking a large panoramic visual image full of spirals and geometric shapes that change in many ways as it moves from left to right on the image.. i need to reaiize a mathematical solution to describe the image <br/><b>pseudonym:</b>can anybody help please<br/><b>x</b>: what is your dilemma?<br/><b>pseudonym:</b>i need to use computer science to realize the mathematics of the image<br/><b>amigojapan:</b>pseudonym: use LOGO :)    good language for drawing shapes,2D shapes<br/><b>pseudonym:</b>amigojapan im not drawing shapes i need to make a recognition programming using OOP<br/><b>amigojapan:</b>pseudonym: maybe use a Neural Network, they are good  at recognizing images<br/><b>pseudonym:</b>amigojapan, im planing on using OOP<br/><b>amigojapan:</b>maybe glance at the image recognition of neural networks herehttps://developer.nvidia.com/digits<br/><b>pseudonym:</b>amigojapan, its not a major recognition program.. just identify curves spirals etc<br/><b>pseudonym:</b>tho im not doing anything complex<br/><b>amigojapan:</b>you are pseudonym<br/><b>pseudonym:</b>its not a complex image<br/><b>amigojapan:</b>pseudonym: paste the image<br/><b>amigojapan:</b>pseudonym: paste the image,  maybe is there are only a limited number of shapes, you could just compare them to the ones on the other image rotating them in every direction and placing them in every position<br/>•amigojapan suspects the image does not even exist<br/><b>pseudonym:</b>amigojapan, strange speculation and paranoia<br/><b>amigojapan:</b>pseudonym: so why not just paste it here?<br/><b>amigojapan:</b>pseudonym: we have had our share of trolls, and after a while you get good at spotting them<br/><b>amigojapan:</b>things like “I am planning on using OOP”    are red flags, cause obviously OOP is not really related to the problem<br/><b>amigojapan:</b>also, that sounds like you want us to explain how to remake computer vision from scratch pseudonym<br/><b>pseudonym:</b>amigojapan i said i could be elaborate, tho you did say you were not the person to ask, so am ending this duscussion<br/><b>amigojapan:</b>pseudonym: that is an excuse not to past the image, which would be the ovious solution to the acusation of troll<br/><b>pseudonym:</b>amigojapan, i never said i planned on pasting the image<br/><b>amigojapan:</b>ok, I am done. my case is made.<br/><b>pseudonym:</b>amigo japan, your being quite silly now<br/><b>pseudonym:</b>and you actualy seemed to be my freind last time i was in.. im ashamed of you
