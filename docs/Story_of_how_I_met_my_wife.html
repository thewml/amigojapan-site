I stayed at one of my friend’s houses, one day while she was away at work, I stumbled on a festival where they carry the Omikoshi, I was invited to carry the Omikoshi. it was fun,  sometime during that day, I met an American girl. after meeting her a few times, she asked me to go to Kyoto with her, which was not really to my liking at the time because I was into "New Japan” not “Old Japan” back then.  But finally she convinced me to go.  when we got to Kyoto, all the hotels where booked solid, and only one place let us in, that was the Toujian backpacker’s hotel. That night it was way over crowded, they even had people sleeping on the roof(outdoors)…  My friend and I where sent to sleep on the roof, I asked one of the staff members (who ended up being my wife) to please let my friend move to a place that was not the roof. that was the first time I met my wife. One day I heard that she was going back to Saitama, so I asked her for her contact number. She gave it to me thinking I would not call.  But when I went back to the Tokyo area I asked her if I could stay in her house.  She reluctantly let me… About a month later we were married.<br/>Our marriage was just by law, we had a small party at Hotel New Koyo. Later on once our son was grown, we got professional photographs taken of us With Shiromuko Kimono and Hakama.
